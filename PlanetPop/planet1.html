                Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is the smallest terrestrial planet and the closest to the Sun. Despite its proximity, its high metal-to-silicate ratio and dynamic geologic history make it uniquely intriguing.
                
                1. Physical Characteristics
                Size, Orbit, and Rotation
                
                With a radius of approximately 2,439 km, Mercury is only slightly larger than our Moon. It orbits the Sun every 88 Earth days and rotates once every 59 Earth days, resulting in one sunrise every 180 Earth days.1
                
                Internal Structure
                
                Mercury possesses an unusually large core (~85% by volume), which includes a partially molten outer layer and a solid inner core of similar size to Earth’s.2 Its crust averages around 35 km in thickness.3
                
                2. Composition and Surface Features
                Core and Mantle
                
                The metallic core, rich in iron and silicon and possibly sulfur, is enveloped by a silicate mantle and secondary crust.4 Observations of mudflakes suggest a reducing environment during formation.5
                
                Surface and Tectonics
                
                The surface is heavily cratered and marked by tectonic features like thrust faults, graben, and wrinkle ridges formed by planetary contraction.6 Shrinkage of up to ~7 km since the initial crustal formation has influenced surface morphology.7 NASA also discovered extensive polar water ice in permanently shadowed craters.8
                
                3. Exploration Missions
                Mercury has been visited by three key spacecraft missions: Mariner 10 (1974–75), MESSENGER (orbited 2011–15), and BepiColombo (en route, currently making flybys; orbital insertion scheduled for 2026).9 MESSENGER mapped 100% of the surface, measured gravity and magnetic fields, and detected a weak magnetic dynamo suggestive of an active liquid core.10
                
                4. Formation and Evolution
                The high density and metallic nature of Mercury may be attributed to giant impact stripping or selective condensation in the early nebula.11 Enriched in volatiles like sulfur and potassium—despite intense thermal conditions—the planet formed under highly reducing conditions.12 Its early volcanic activity ceased as the planet cooled and shrank (~3.8 billion years ago).13
                
                5. Recent Discoveries
                MESSENGER data reveal a probable solid inner core and evidence of a diamond-rich layer at the mantle-core boundary—formed by the crystallization of a carbon-rich magma ocean.14 Wrinkle ridges and small thrust faults indicate tectonic activity possibly less than 50 million years old.15
                
                Conclusion
                Mercury is an exceptional world: small yet dense, hot yet icy, crushed by its own contraction yet revealing an active geologic and magnetic interior. Upcoming data from BepiColombo promise to deepen our understanding of its origin, evolution, and magnetic dynamics</p>
